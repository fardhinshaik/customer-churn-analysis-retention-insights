# Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Insights

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using telecom customer data. The objective is to identify key churn drivers and provide actionable insights to support customer retention strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic data visualization (Matplotlib)

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn
- Churn distribution analysis
- Churn analysis by contract type and payment method
- Pricing impact analysis using monthly charges
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) comparison
- Rule-based customer risk segmentation (High / Medium / Low risk)

## Key Findings
- Customers on month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn
- Electronic check payment users churn more compared to auto-pay users
- High-risk customers were identified using business rules

## Business Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts through incentives
- Promote auto-pay payment methods
- Apply targeted retention strategies for high-risk customers
- Focus retention efforts on high-CLTV customers

## Outcome
The analysis helps businesses understand churn behavior and prioritize customer retention efforts using data-driven insights.
